## ✨ Key Features

### 🏊 Swim Lanes (New!)

Organize your board into horizontal swim lanes for a powerful two-dimensional view of your workflow:

- **Flexible Grouping**: Group tasks by **label**, **label group**, or **priority** — each mode creates distinct swim lane rows
- **Drag & Drop Across Lanes**: Move tasks between columns, lanes, or both in a single gesture — lane assignments update automatically
- **Per-Cell Control**: Collapse/expand individual swim lane cells, entire rows, or workflow columns independently
- **Quick Task Creation**: Add tasks directly to any swim lane cell with automatic label/priority assignment
- **Smart Done Column**: Done tasks are hidden in swim lanes to keep rows compact, while the Done column remains a drag-and-drop target
- **Sticky Headers**: Lane headers stay pinned during horizontal scrolling; workflow headers stay visible during vertical scrolling
- **Mobile Optimized**: Responsive flex layout with sticky lane headers and snap-scrolling columns on mobile
- **Persistent State**: All swim lane settings, collapsed states, and lane assignments are saved per board

Configure swim lanes in **Settings** — choose your grouping mode and start organizing!

## 🛡️ Data Security & Persistence

Your data is stored securely in your browser's `localStorage`. It persists across sessions and survives cache clears. For extra safety, use the built-in export feature to save backups to your preferred cloud storage.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get up and running in minutes!

### For Users: Try It Now
1. Visit the **[Live Demo](https://mdiener21.github.io/personal-kanban/)**.
2. Start creating boards, tasks, and labels immediately.
3. Export your data anytime for backup.

### For Developers: Host Your Own
The repository includes a pre-built static site in `dist/`. Simply upload it to any web host.

1. Copy the `dist/` folder.
2. Upload to your web host (e.g., [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/de/webhosting), Netlify, Vercel).
3. Done! Your personal Kanban board is live.

## 🛠️ Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mdiener21/personal-kanban.git
   cd personal-kanban
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will open at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```
Built files are in `dist/`.

### Preview Production Build
```bash
npm run preview
```

### Generate a Release

Use the `Generate Release` workflow to automate release preparation:
- `npm ci` + `npm run build`
- version bump (`package.json` + `package-lock.json`)
- changelog promotion from `Unreleased`
- creation/update of a release PR (`release/vX.Y.Z` → `main`)

After the release PR is merged, `Publish Release` runs automatically on `main` and:
- creates/pushes tag `vX.Y.Z`
- publishes GitHub Release with notes extracted from `CHANGELOG.md`

`Publish Release` is triggered on every push to `main`, but it only creates a tag/release when that version tag does not already exist.

GitHub CLI example:

```bash
gh workflow run release.yml --ref main -f bump=patch
```

Use `bump=minor` or `bump=major` when needed.

If your repo blocks Actions from opening PRs, enable repository setting:
`Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests`.

### Run Tests

This project uses a four-layer test stack:

- `Vitest` for pure unit tests in `tests/unit/`
- `Vitest` + `@testing-library/dom` for DOM integration tests in `tests/dom/`
- `MSW` for mocked API behavior shared by Vitest suites from `tests/mocks/`
- `Playwright` for end-to-end and visual/accessibility smoke coverage in `tests/e2e/`

Run the full automated test stack:

```bash
npm test
```

Run only the unit tests:

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

Run only the DOM integration tests:

```bash
npm run test:dom
```

Run only the Playwright E2E tests:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

Run only the create-task E2E tests ([tests/e2e/create-task.spec.ts](tests/e2e/create-task.spec.ts)):

```bash
npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/create-task.spec.ts
```

The detailed strategy, folder layout, and naming convention live in [docs/testing-strategy.md](docs/testing-strategy.md).
