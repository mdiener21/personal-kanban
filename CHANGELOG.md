## Unreleased

### Added (unreleased)

- Same-day completions report section: KPIs (this week, last week, avg per week) and a 12-week bar sparkline showing tasks created and completed on the same day

### Changed (unreleased)

- Tasks in the Done column no longer show overdue/urgency countdown styling; due date is displayed without countdown text in neutral styling. Updates immediately on drag-drop.
- Column color picker now displays hex color code alongside the color selector, matching the label editor UX
- Added a quick-access Notifications bell beside the menu button while keeping Notifications in the controls dropdown; both buttons now show the same live notification count badge and open the same modal
- Improved drag-drop performance for Done column: disabled internal sorting of done (tasks always placed at top of done) and eliminated redundant localStorage reads during drop operations
- Added a manual GitHub Actions release pipeline (`Generate Release`) that runs build, bumps version/changelog, pushes commit and tag, and publishes a GitHub Release with changelog notes

### Removed (unreleased)

## [1.1.2] - 2026-02-14

### Added (1.1.2)

- Create Board modal now includes a Template dropdown to create a new board from a built-in template (or start blank)

  - Shows only days for periods < 30 days (e.g., "5 days", "tomorrow", "today")
  - Three-tier color coding for quick visual prioritization (configurable in Settings):
    - Red: within urgent threshold (default: < 3 days to due)
    - Amber: within warning threshold (default: 3-10 days to due)
    - Default: beyond warning threshold (default: > 10 days to due)
  - Overdue tasks show "overdue by X days" or "overdue by X months Y days"
- Countdown color threshold settings in Settings modal

  - Per-board configuration allows different workflows for different boards

### Changed (2026-02-14)

### Removed (2026-02-14)


## [1.0.13] - 2026-02-10

### Added (1.0.13)

- Calendar page (`calendar.html`) showing a one-month due-date calendar with per-day counts and a clickable list of tasks due on the selected date (each task link opens the task on the board); linked from the main menu

### Changed (1.0.13)

- Task description textarea in task modal now supports vertical resizing (user can drag to expand height while width stays fixed)

## [1.0.12] - 2026-02-09

### Added (1.0.12)

- Playwright E2E test suite (`npm test`) covering boards, task creation/validation, and drag/drop performance scenarios.

### Changed (1.0.12)

- Drag/drop now prefers native HTML5 drag-and-drop on non-touch pointers (keeps SortableJS fallback for touch/coarse pointers) to improve first-drag reliability on desktop and compatibility with Playwright automation.
- Modals now keep the action buttons (Cancel/Save/Close) sticky at the bottom while the modal content scrolls, preventing the actions from flowing off-screen.
- Task priority now supports `urgent` (above high) and `none` (below low), and the default priority is now `none`.

### Removed (1.0.12)

## [1.0.11] - 2026-02-06

### Added (1.0.11)

- **Performance optimization**: Incremental task drop updates avoid full board re-render, dramatically improving drag-drop speed into columns with 100+ tasks
- **Done column virtualization**: Initially renders 50 tasks with "Show more" button to load additional batches, enabling smooth performance with 300+ completed tasks
- **Test infrastructure**: Playwright E2E tests with performance fixtures (300+ tasks) to ensure drag-drop completes in <1 second
- Test scripts: `npm test`, `npm run test:ui`, `npm run test:debug`
- Test fixture generator: `tests/fixtures/generate-fixture.js` creates performance test boards with 300+ tasks
- "Show more" button styling for virtualized task lists in Done column
- Task title now clamps to a single line with ellipsis on cards

### Changed (1.0.11)

- Drag-drop now uses `updateTaskPositionsFromDrop()` for targeted updates instead of full `renderBoard()`, reducing post-drop work from O(n*m) to O(affected columns only)
- Task `columnHistory` only updates when task changes columns (not for reorders within same column), reducing unnecessary data writes
- Label loading optimized: pre-loads labels into Map once per render instead of repeated `loadLabels()` calls per task
- Task counters and collapsed column titles sync incrementally after drop without DOM rebuild
- Notifications refresh only when tasks move between columns (not on reorder)
- `createTaskElement()` now accepts pre-loaded labels map as optional parameter for performance
- Task card layout: due date and age render together in the footer bottom row
- Reports bundle size reduced by switching ECharts to modular imports (only required charts/components)

### Removed (1.0.11)

## [1.0.10] - 2026-02-06

### Changed (1.0.10)

- Refactored monolithic `design.css` (2,285 lines) into a modular CSS architecture under `src/styles/` with 16 focused files organized by concern (tokens, base, layout, utilities, responsive, and 10 component files)
- Manage Labels modal now uses an accordion to group labels; first group expanded by default, others collapsed
- Extracted reusable accordion component (`src/modules/accordion.js`, `src/styles/components/accordion.css`) with generic `createAccordionSection(title, items, expanded, renderItem)` API
- Board-level task search now also matches label group names (e.g., searching "People" shows all tasks with labels in the People group)

## [1.0.9] - 2026-02-06
