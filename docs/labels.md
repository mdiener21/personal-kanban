> Labels help you categorize and filter tasks without changing your workflow columns.

Use **columns** to track workflow state (To Do → In Progress → Done) and use **labels** for categories like type, area, context, and activity. With **label groups**, you can keep labels organized and easy to scan.

**🚀 [Try the Live Demo](https://mdiener21.github.io/personal-kanban/) and see labels in action!**

## 📁 Quick Example Boards

Kickstart your setup with these ready-to-import boards featuring label examples:

- **[Eisenhower-Method-Board.json](example-boards/Eisenhower-Method-Board.json)** — Prioritize with urgent/important quadrants.
- **[Getting-Things-Done-Template.json](example-boards/Getting-Things-Done-Template.json)** — GTD workflow for productivity.
- **[Personal-Work-Kanban-Template.json](example-boards/Personal-Work-Kanban-Template.json)** — Balanced personal and work tasks.
- **[Personal_Demo_board.json](example-boards/Personal_Demo_board.json)** — Demo board with sample labels.
- **[Development_board.json](example-boards/Development_board.json)** — Software development kanban.
- **[Project-Management-Board-Template.json](example-boards/Project-Management-Board-Template.json)** — Type/Area label groups.
- **[Sales_board_template.json](example-boards/Sales_board_template.json)** — Source/Industry/Region/Activity groups.

**Import Tip**: Click **Import** in the app and select any JSON file above!

Import creates a **new board** from the JSON and switches to it.

## ✅ Labels vs Columns vs Priority (fast rules)

- **Columns = state**: To Do / In Progress / Review / Done.
- **Priority = urgency**: Use the built-in priority field (urgent/high/medium/low/none) instead of creating “Urgent” labels.
- **Labels = category**: Use labels to answer “what kind of work is this?” or “where does it belong?”

Avoid using labels like **Blocked**, **Won/Lost**, **In Review**, etc. Those are clearer as columns.

## 🎯 How Labels & Groups Work

- **Labels**: Colored tags you assign to tasks (e.g., "Feature", "Bug", "Home"). Each label has a name, color, and optional group.
- **Groups**: Organize labels into sections (e.g., "Activity", "People", "Type", "Area"). Groups make the label picker and management modal cleaner and more searchable.
- **Search & Filter**: Find tasks by label name or group name—super fast!
- **Customization**: Create, edit, and delete labels/groups to fit your workflow.

**Pro Tip**: Use groups to avoid label clutter. For example, group "Meeting" and "Email" under "Activity" group.

## 🛠️ Managing Labels & Groups

1. **Create a Label**: In the Manage Labels modal, add a name, pick a color, and optionally assign a group.
2. **Group Suggestions**: The app autocompletes group names from existing ones.
3. **Organize**: Labels appear grouped in accordions—expand/collapse for easy browsing.
4. **Assign to Tasks**: In the task modal, check labels organized by group.
5. **Search**: Filter labels by name or group in the management modal.
