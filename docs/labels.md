> **Unlock the power of smart organization!** Labels and groups help you categorize, filter, and find tasks effortlessly—turning chaos into clarity.

Labels are your secret weapon for task management. Use columns to track status, state, progress (e.g., To Do → In Progress → Done), and labels for context,  and filtering. With **label groups**, you can organize labels into logical categories, making everything even more intuitive.

## 🎯 How Labels & Groups Work

- **Labels**: Colored tags you assign to tasks (e.g., "Feature", "Bug", "Home"). Each label has a name, color, and optional group.
- **Groups**: Organize labels into sections (e.g., "Activity", "People", "Type", "Area"). Groups make the label picker and management modal cleaner and more searchable.
- **Search & Filter**: Find tasks by label name or group name—super fast!
- **Customization**: Create, edit, and delete labels/groups to fit your workflow.

**Pro Tip**: Use groups to avoid label clutter. For example, group "Meeting" and "Email" under "Activity" group.

## 🛠️ Managing Labels & Groups

1. **Create a Label**: In the Manage Labels modal, add a name, pick a color, and optionally assign a group.
2. **Group Suggestions**: The app autocompletes group names from existing ones.
3. **Organize**: Labels appear grouped in accordions—expand/collapse for easy browsing.
4. **Assign to Tasks**: In the task modal, check labels organized by group.
5. **Search**: Filter labels by name or group in the management modal.
