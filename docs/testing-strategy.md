# Testing Strategy

This project uses a lean four-layer test stack designed for a pure JavaScript Vite app:

- `Vitest` for fast unit tests
- `Vitest` + `@testing-library/dom` for DOM integration tests
- `MSW` for mocked API behavior in Vitest suites
- `Playwright` for end-to-end, visual, and accessibility smoke coverage

## Goals

- Keep pure logic tests fast and isolated.
- Verify DOM behavior without requiring a real browser for every change.
- Mock network behavior consistently even as the app adds more API-backed features.
- Reserve Playwright for high-value user journeys and browser-level assertions.

## Folder Layout

```text
tests/
  unit/
  dom/
  e2e/
  mocks/
```

Supporting folders remain valid:

- `tests/fixtures/` for JSON data and large sample boards
- `tests/helpers/` for shared test-only utilities
- `tests/test-plans/` for manual or generated Playwright planning artifacts

## Naming Convention

### Unit tests

- Location: `tests/unit/`
- File name: `<module>.test.js`
- Scope: pure functions, data normalization, storage wrappers, constants, validators, and state helpers

Examples:

- `tests/unit/storage.test.js`
- `tests/unit/dateutils.test.js`
- `tests/unit/swimlanes-utils.test.js`

### DOM integration tests

- Location: `tests/dom/`
- File name: `<feature>.test.js`
- Scope: rendered HTML, keyboard and pointer interactions, focus behavior, form validation, modal state, and accessibility-oriented DOM assertions

Examples:

- `tests/dom/accordion.test.js`
- `tests/dom/task-modal.test.js`
- `tests/dom/settings-panel.test.js`

### Mock API files

- Location: `tests/mocks/`
- Shared entry points:
  - `handlers.js`
  - `server.js`
- Feature-specific mock files should use `<feature>.handlers.js` when the suite grows beyond the shared default set.

Examples:

- `tests/mocks/handlers.js`
- `tests/mocks/import-export.handlers.js`

### End-to-end tests

- Location: `tests/e2e/`
- File name: `<journey>.spec.ts`
- Scope: full user journeys, cross-module regressions, stable screenshots, and accessibility smoke checks on critical flows

Examples:

- `tests/e2e/create-task.spec.ts`
- `tests/e2e/validation-missing-title.spec.ts`

## Scripts

- `npm test` — run unit, DOM, and E2E suites in sequence
- `npm run test:unit` — run only unit tests
- `npm run test:dom` — run only DOM integration tests
- `npm run test:e2e` — run only Playwright E2E tests
- `npm run test:ui` — open Playwright UI mode
- `npm run test:debug` — run Playwright in debug mode

## What Goes Where

### Put a test in `tests/unit/` when:

- It does not need `document`, layout, or events.
- It only exercises inputs, outputs, and state transitions.
- It should stay extremely fast and deterministic.

### Put a test in `tests/dom/` when:

- It needs `document.body`, event dispatching, or focus assertions.
- It verifies modal behavior, menus, keyboard shortcuts, or rendered task/column UI.
- It benefits from `@testing-library/dom` queries such as `getByRole()` or `getByText()`.

### Use `tests/mocks/` when:

- A Vitest suite needs consistent success, empty, error, or timeout responses.
- You want to reuse the same network behavior across multiple DOM or integration tests.

### Put a test in `tests/e2e/` when:

- The behavior spans multiple modules or requires a real browser.
- Drag-drop, routing, import/export flows, or persistent browser storage must be exercised together.
- You need screenshots or accessibility smoke checks on stable views.

## Recommended Growth Pattern

1. Start with `tests/unit/` for new pure helpers.
2. Add `tests/dom/` coverage when a feature has meaningful UI behavior.
3. Add or extend `tests/mocks/` once the feature depends on network responses.
4. Add `tests/e2e/` only for critical journeys and regressions that require a real browser.

## Current Scaffold

- `tests/dom/setup.js` resets `document.body` and browser-like globals between DOM tests.
- `tests/dom/accordion.test.js` is the reference shape for a DOM integration test using `@testing-library/dom`.
- `tests/dom/msw-example.test.js` demonstrates `Vitest` + `MSW` + `@testing-library/dom` working together.
- `tests/mocks/handlers.js` and `tests/mocks/server.js` are the shared default mock entry points.
