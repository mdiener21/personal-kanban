## ✅ Best Practices for Creating Boards

- **Model workflow state as columns**: Use columns like **To Do → In Progress → Review → Done** to represent the *status* of work.
- **Use priority**  not labels for priorities (we have a dedicated priority function for you with sensible defaults )
- **Use labels for “what it is,” not “where it is”**: Good label examples include *type* (Bug, Feature), *area* (Finance, HR), *context* (Home, Work), or *activity* (Email, Meeting, Meeting-Prep, Task).
- **Avoid labels like “Blocked”, “Won/Lost”, “Backlog”, “New Lead”**: These read as states and are clearer as columns.
- **Start simple (3–6 columns)**: Add more columns only when you repeatedly ask “what’s the next step?”
- **Keep column names action-oriented**: Prefer “Ready for Review” over vague terms like “Waiting”.
- **Add a dedicated “Blocked” column if you need it**: It makes stuck work visible without mixing it into labels.

## 🎯 Standard Workflow Columns

Most boards use these core stages for progress tracking:

- **To Do** — Tasks awaiting action
- **In Progress** — Active work
- **Review** — Quality checks or feedback
- **Blocked** — Stuck, needs resolution
- **Done** — Completed successfully

Adjust based on your needs—add, rename, or reorder columns anytime.
