# Tasks

## Create and Edit

- Tasks are created from a column header plus button or from a swim lane cell plus button
- Task form fields: title, description, priority, due date, column, labels
- Title is required and validates inline with red error styling
- Edit mode opens with existing task values prefilled
- The edit modal includes a fullscreen action on larger screens and a dedicated close button

## Placement and Ordering

- New tasks are inserted at the top of the selected column with `order = 1`
- Standard drag and drop can move tasks between columns
- In swim lane mode, a single drag can change both column and lane
- Storage keeps task ordering flattened per column even while swim lanes are enabled

## Card Display

- Task cards show title, optional description, labels, priority badge, delete button, and optional footer metadata
- Titles are clamped to one line and descriptions to a short preview
- Footer content is controlled by settings and can include change date, due date, countdown, and task age

## Due Dates and Age

- `changeDate` is formatted with the selected locale using `toLocaleString(locale)`
- Due dates are displayed as `Due MM/DD/YYYY (countdown)` when countdowns are enabled
- Countdown text shows days for short ranges and months plus days for longer ranges
- Overdue tasks display `overdue by ...`
- Urgency coloring uses configurable red and amber thresholds from settings
- Tasks in the Done column show due dates without countdown text or urgency coloring
- Task age is derived from `creationDate` and displayed as years, months, and days as applicable

## Labels in Task Modal

- Selected labels are shown as colored pills with remove buttons
- Available labels can be filtered through a search field
- The label search field can open the Add Label modal without losing in-progress task edits
- When no label matches a search, the UI offers a create-label action prefilled with the search term

## Task List Size Controls

- Columns with more than 12 tasks show a scrollbar and optional "Show all tasks (N)" control
- Expanded task lists use up to `80vh`

Update this file when you change:

- task fields or validation
